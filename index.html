  <p>The software design process is the complete process of planning, analyzing, designing, implementing, testing, and maintaining a software program. The exact cycle of the software development process depends on the development model the developer chooses to use; let us take the waterfall model as an example. Programs start from the planning and analysis stage, where we set the requirements for the program and plan the program's basic structure. After the planning and analysis comes the implementation stage; this stage usually takes the most time, due to which some people see the implementation as the whole software design process, which is invalid. After the implementation stage, there are testing and maintaining stages, which are equally crucial, if not more crucial, than the previous stages. During the testing stage, developers build test cases to try and find errors in the program; this often needs to be clarified with debugging, which it is not. After satisfactory testing, the final task is maintaining the software, keeping it up-to-date, adding new features, and keeping it up to the latest standards. This process was an example of only one design model; many others have different advantages and disadvantages.

  The process of software design is crucial to the lifestyle of almost everyone in the world. Without the help of the complete software design process, which includes design, implementing testing, and maintaining stages, developing a program would be extremely difficult or impossible. Without it, there would be no bug-free programs. Programs would be half-baked or non-functional. Programs crucial to people, such as Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and countless others, would not be here without the software design process. As previously mentioned, an example of well-designed software that many people have used is the complete Microsoft Office suite; the tasks it performs are pretty simple at times, however simple. Intuitive program is at the heart of many people's lifestyle. Its elegant and intuitive design is why many people use it daily, from writing academic essays to storing aircraft arrival and departure times; this software is used all over because of its openness, quality design, and an unbelievable amount of backward compatibility going back to 2008 and before. These are some reasons why the Microsoft Office suite is seen as one of the best-designed software of today's time.

  Requirements are a set of operations the software must perform, i.e., What the client wants the software to do. During the requirement-gathering, the client provides a user story, which the software team must interpret and turn into requirements, or the client must provide a clear and concise requirement list that the software developing team can follow. The requirement-gathering stage is one of the most critical stages of the software development process, as without precise and clear requirements, the software will not behave as the client or developer expected it to, resulting in rewrites of the code with further debugging and testing, wasting time and capital which could have been spent on further improving the software like adding new features or polishing it.<br>

  Some examples of the user requirements I would set if I got to develop the software I think was well designed, which is the Microsoft Office suite.<br>

  1. The user should be able to sign up with an email address and password<br>

  2. The user should be able to search or select values from the database.<br>

  3. The user should be able to export documents as CSV or PDF, depending upon the original file type.<br>

  4. The user should be able to import their documents from other machines or software.<br>

  5. The user should be able to store their documents locally.<br>
