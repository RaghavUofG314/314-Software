  <p>The software design process is the complete process of planning, analyzing, designing, implementing, testing, and maintaining a software program. The exact cycle of the software development process depends on the development model the developer chooses to use; let us take the waterfall model as an example. Programs start from the planning and analysis stage, where we set the requirements for the program and plan the program's basic structure. After the planning and analysis comes the implementation stage; this stage usually takes the most time, due to which some people see the implementation as the whole software design process, which is invalid. After the implementation stage, there are testing and maintaining stages, which are equally crucial, if not more crucial, than the previous stages. During the testing stage, developers build test cases to try and find errors in the program; this often needs to be clarified with debugging, which it is not. After satisfactory testing, the final task is to maintain the software, keeping it up-to-date, adding new features, and keeping it up to the latest standards. This process was an example of only one design model; many others have different advantages and disadvantages.

  The process of software design is crucial to the lifestyle of almost everyone in the world; without the software design process, there would be bug-free programs. Programs would be half-baked or non-functional. Programs crucial to people, such as Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and countless others, would only be here with the software design process.
    
  As previously mentioned, an example of well-designed software that many people, including me, have used is the complete Microsoft Office suite; the tasks it performs are pretty simple at times, however simple. Intuitive program is at the heart of many people's lifestyle. The elegant design and its intuitive usage are why many people use it daily, from writing academic essays to storing aircraft arrival and departure times; this software is used all over because of its openness, quality design, and an unbelievable amount of backward compatibility going back to 2008 and before. The amount of backward compatibility, quality, and openness of the software is why the Microsoft Office suite is seen as one of the best-designed software of today's time.</p>
