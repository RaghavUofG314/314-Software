  <p>The software design process is the complete process of planning, analyzing, designing, implementing, testing, and maintaining a software program. The exact cycle of the software development process depends on the development model the developer chooses to use; let us take the waterfall model as an example. Programs start from the planning and analysis stage, where we set the requirements for the program and plan the program's basic structure. After the planning and analysis comes the implementation stage; this stage usually takes the most time, due to which some people see the implementation as the whole software design process, which is invalid. After the implementation stage, there are testing and maintaining stages, which are equally crucial, if not more crucial, than the previous stages. During the testing stage, developers build test cases to try and find errors in the program; this often needs to be clarified with debugging, which it is not. After satisfactory testing, the final task is maintaining the software, keeping it up-to-date, adding new features, and keeping it up to the latest standards. This process was an example of only one design model; many others have different advantages and disadvantages.<br>
  <br>
  The process of software design is crucial to the lifestyle of almost everyone in the world. Without the help of the complete software design process, which includes design, implementing testing, and maintaining stages, developing a program would be extremely difficult or impossible. Without it, there would be no bug-free programs. Programs would be half-baked or non-functional. Programs crucial to people, such as Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and countless others, would not be here without the software design process. As previously mentioned, an example of well-designed software that many people have used is the complete Microsoft Office suite; the tasks it performs are pretty simple at times, however simple. Intuitive program is at the heart of many people's lifestyle. Its elegant and intuitive design is why many people use it daily, from writing academic essays to storing aircraft arrival and departure times; this software is used all over because of its openness, quality design, and an unbelievable amount of backward compatibility going back to 2008 and before. These are some reasons why the Microsoft Office suite is seen as one of the best-designed software of today's time.

    Requirements are a set of operations the software must perform, i.e., What the client wants the software to do. During the requirement-gathering, the client provides a user story, which the software team must interpret and turn into requirements, or the client must provide a clear and concise requirement list that the software developing team can follow. The requirement-gathering stage is one of the most critical stages of the software development process, as without precise and clear requirements, the software will not behave as the client or developer expected it to, resulting in rewrites of the code with further debugging and testing, wasting time and capital which could have been spent on further improving the software like adding new features or polishing it.<br>
    <br>
    Some examples of the user stories that some users would say for the software I think was well designed, which is the Microsoft Office suite.<br>
    <br>
    1. As a student, I want better auto error correction and predictive text so that I can write more things in less time, having to worry less about mistakes and save time on editing those mistakes<br>
    <br>
    2. As a non-native English speaker, I want better and more translations in the software so that I can read the text effectively and spend more time doing my work<br>
    <br>
    3. As a developer, I want better interconnectivity between text editors, databases and the Microsoft Office suite so that I can optimize my work experience and implement things more effectively.<br>
    <br>
    4. As a corporate manager, I want more statistics about screen time and productivity so that I can effectively monitor the work levels and productivity of my team.<br>
    <br>
    5. As an accountant, I want more accessible access to mathematical tools in the software so that I can spend less time looking for such tools and improve my productivity<br>

      Empathy comprises three elements: culture, emotions, and context.<br>
      <br>
      Emotions are feelings experienced by individuals. Factors influence these feelings and are unique to each person. Businesses need to consider each individual's emotions as they can significantly impact their decision-making process.<br>
      Culture refers to the values that can influence how individuals make decisions. Businesses must be mindful of their importance as they often play a role in shaping consumer choices.<br>
      Context is the situational factors around the person that can influence their decision-making process.<br>
      <br> 
      Businesses should tailor their approach based on factors to foster a sense of loyalty among consumers. Companies should consider their emotions, culture, and context when interacting with customers. Doing business can enhance customer satisfaction and foster loyalty.<br>
      <br>
      Old-school business models have often viewed people as consumers who engage with a business for transactions. They have seen them as trend followers or rational actors driven by profit.<br>
      <br>
      The profit-driven model perceives people as customers with whom the business exchanges products to generate profits.<br>
      The "sheep" model regards customers as influenced individuals targeted through marketing and advertising techniques. This model shows a disregard for customer satisfaction.<br>
      The "homo economicus" model, which assumes a person's decision-making process is exclusively based on calculations, fails to consider the roles of behavior and emotions in that process.<br>
      <br>
      These old-school models show a significant lack of elements of empathy.<br> 
      The profit-driven model ignores emotions, reducing customers to only those the business transacts with to generate a profit.<br> 
      The "sheep" model reduces customers to a person who would follow what is popular and marketed heavily; this model fails to understand emotions and context.<br>
      While the "homo economicus" model neglects the role of emotions of a person in the process of their decision making<br>
